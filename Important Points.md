export default function App({Component, pageProp}) {
    return (
        <Component {...pageProp}/>
    )
} this is next.js code explain this code that what is Component and pageProp and why we use that
This code is a functional component in Next.js, which is a popular React-based framework for building web applications.

Explain:

Component is a prop that is passed to the component. It represents a React component that will be rendered in the component.
pageProp is another prop that is passed to the component. It is an object that contains any props that need to be passed to the Component.
The component uses the spread operator ({...pageProp}) to pass the properties of the pageProp object to the Component as props. This allows the Component to access the properties it needs for rendering.

In Next.js, this component is often used as a default export for customizing the appearance of pages. The Component and pageProp props are passed dynamically from the Next.js router, allowing for different components to be rendered for different pages.
